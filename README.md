Our smart photoboothing solution.

## What's done so far

* `mailing.py` contains the mailing engine...

## What do we have to do ?

the game loop, the camera preview, "off-line" mode, light system, electronic, Web Platform.

## Nota Bene

I don't understand why, but it seems to appear that the indentation is wrong in some places in `main.py`... My local file is fine though..
